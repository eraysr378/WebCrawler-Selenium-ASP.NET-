# Introduction 
This is a web crawler. All the necessary instructions should be given as flows. You can create a list of flows and save them as JSON to use later.<br />
You can give an excel file that contains product names as input to search and after you save the sites to crawl,<br />
the program crawls all of those sites and shows the results, you can export the results as an excel file if you want.<br />
In this video it is shown that how the process works. In this video I used a json file that includes all the flows to search the first appearing item in three sites (trendyol, akakce,n11) <br />
